Personal Portfolio – Apurva Aggarwal
apurva0510.github.io

This is a heavily customized personal portfolio site for Apurva Aggarwal,
built on top of the "Read Only" template by HTML5 UP.

The site has been adapted with:
- A custom Apple-style navigation bar with logo and social links
- Updated content focused on data, AI, sustainability, and RA leadership
- A projects section highlighting FarmX, the Grammys analytics work, and Intel sustainability analytics
- A working contact form wired to Formspree
- Custom favicon and app icons

The original template is a simple single-page responsive layout designed
for personal sites and portfolios. It includes a contact form, pre-styled
elements, and Sass sources.

This project uses that template as a base and extends/modifies it for a
personal portfolio use case.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments for the original template are welcome:
